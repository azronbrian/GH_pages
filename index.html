    <h1>Using GitHub pages to host static site.</h1>
    <p>GitHub can not only store your profiles remotely but also host your project. 
        This happens freely for public repositories. If your repo is private, 
        you'll need to upgrade in order to host your project.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Initialize git init in your project files directory</li>
        <li>Add all the projects files</li>
        <li>Commit them using suitable messages</li>
        <li>Create a new repo in your GitHub account</li>
        <li>Push the existing repo from your computer to the newly created Github repo</li>
        <li>Go to GitHub pages settings and select branch and root directory then save.</li>
        <li>You will be provided with a live link for your hosted project.</li>
    </ol>
